Contributing
-----
Thank you for considering contributing to Willow! We're happy to have you here.
Before you get started, please read over our contributing guidelines.

Before making contributions, setup a local installation of Willow by following
the instructions in the project README.
When making contributions, try to follow two basic guidelines:

1. **Readability:** Closely follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).
Currently, there is no enforcement of these rules, but there is an ESLint
configuration for the project which can be used for client-side linting. A pull
request that does not follow this style guide is subject to declination.

2. **Simplicity:** Code should be simple and easy to understand. Avoid adding
additional dependencies, especially if there is already an existing dependency
that can do what you need. Make sure changes that impact the user interface or
any other user-facing elements are intuitive and follow the latest
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20/).

In the title and body of your pull request, please briefly describe the changes
and how they were implemented. Then, the pull request will be reviewed by
project maintainers.
